# Language Locked Chat

A chat application where users can only see messages in languages known by their currently selected 'actor'. Created to facilitate Dungeons and Dragons games, making in-game language matter a bit more. Also, for fun, created using as little client-side JavaScript as possible.

Backend will likely be rewritten in Go to hopefully save on server costs.
